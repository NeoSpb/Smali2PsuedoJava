Smali2PsuedoJava is a small java application that converts Smali codes to Java-like codes.

Input: Smali code generated by apktool
Output: PsuedoJava (Java-like code)

To use, enter this command in CLI

java -jar Smali2PsuedoJava.jar inputFile/inputDirectory [--use-param-names]

inputFile/inputDirectory
- The input smali file or directory containning smali files
- If is inputFile, a same name file with extension .java will be created at the same directory
- If is inputDirectory, a s2pjout directory will be generated inside the input directory. The s2pj directory will contain all the .java files
- If --use-param-names is specified, parameter names will be replaced by their actual names instead of the register names

This is still a work in progress and any feedback is appreciated
